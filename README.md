# MobiTest

MobiTest is a multifunctional Parkinson's Disease monitor which can track motor functionality using three tests to gauge the severity of Parkinson's Disease. 

1. Static Spiral Test: This test tests the finger tremors. In this test, the user starts from the right side and traces the spiral towards the center.
2. Dynamic Spiral test: This test is similar to the Static Spiral Test, except that the spiral flashes on and off to increase difficulty.
3. Stability Test: This test tests the finger control. In this tests, the user tries to keep their finger as steady as possible on a point shown on the screen for 10 seconds.

At the end of each test, a graph is generated showing the overall curvature of the user's tracing. A curve closer to 180 degrees demonstrates the best control and stability. The score for each test is visible after the user has taken all the three tests. Results closer to zero demonstrate that the possibility of Parkinson's is low.

Another unique feature that this app provides is an Accessible Keyboard. This keyboard drastically improves communication with someone who has speech impediments, a common yet overlooked effect of PD.
